## Exercise 3: Create an Azure Files Share for FSLogix

Duration:  90 minutes

In this exercise, you will be creating an Azure File share and enabling SMB access via Active Directory authentication. Azure Files is a platform service (PaaS) and is one of the recommended solutions for hosting FSLogix containers for AVD users. At the end of this exercise, you will have the following components:

-   A new storage account in your Azure subscription.

-   A new Azure file share for your FSLogix profile containers.

-   AD authentication enabled for your Azure storage account.

-   Permissions applied for user access to the file share.

### Task 1: Create a storage account

Before you can work with an Azure file share, you need to create an Azure storage account. To create a general-purpose v2 storage account in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1.  In the Azure Portal, type **storage accounts** in the **Search resources** field. Select **Storage accounts** from the list.

    ![This image shows how to access the search menu bar, and search for storage accounts.](media/storageaccount.png "Search for storage accounts")

2.  On the Storage Accounts window that appears, select **+ Add**.

    ![This image shows how to select the Add icon to create a new storage account.](media/addstorageaccount.png "Add a storage account")

3.  Fill in the required parameters for the storage account as given below:

  - Subscription: *Select the default subscription*. 
   
  - Resource Group: *Select **AVD-RG** from the drop down*. 
   
  - Storage account name: **<inject key="Storage Account Name" />**   
      
  - Region: **East US**, *this should be same as the location of your resource group*.  
   
  - Performance: **Standard**   
      
  - Redundancy: **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)**
   
  - Click on **Review + Create**

    ![This image shows how to enter the information to create a new storage account.](media/createstorage1.png "Create a storage account")

4. At last, Select **Create**.

    ![This image shows how to enter the information to create a new storage account.](media/reviewcreate.png "Create a storage account")

5. Once the deployment is ready, select **Go to resource**. This will take you to the storage account you just created.

   ![This image shows how to enter the information to create a new storage account.](media/gotoresource1.png "Create a storage account")

### Task 2: Create an Azure file share 

1.  On the **storage accounts** page, select **File shares** and select **+ File Share**.

    ![This image shows that once the storage account is created, from the overview blade, to select File shares.](media/storagefileshare1.png "Create a File share")

2.  Enter a Name for the new file share, enter a quota in gigabits, select **Hot** Tier, and select **Create**.

    ![This image shows how to give the file share a name and a storage quota in gigabits.](media/newfileshare.png "New File share")
    
> **Note**: The file share quota supports a maximum of 5,120 GiB and can be managed on the File shares blade.

### Task 3: Enable AD authentication for your storage account

**Prerequisites**

1.  The steps in this task need to be completed from a domain joined computer. The **AzFilesHybrid** module uses the AD PowerShell module, so running from a server is preferred.

    ![](media/openpowersellise.png)

2.  The account used in this task needs to meet the following requirements:

    -    Synchronized with Azure AD.

    -    Permissions to create user or computer objects in Active Directory.

    -    Owner or Contributor rights on the Storage account.

In this task, you will be completing the steps on the Domain Controller in Azure using an account that has been assigned Global Administrator and Domain Administrator. In a production environment, you can scale this back if you meet the minimum requirements above.

**Setup**

1.  From a domain joined computer, download, and unzip the [AzFilesHybrid module](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-files-samples/releases).

    **Link address**: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-files-samples/releases   

2. From the GitHub repository, select and download the AzFilesHybrid.zip file to the domain joined computer **Documents** folder.

    ![This image shows the view of the GitHub site for Azure samples.](media/azfileshybriddownload.png "Azure samples")

3. From the popup in the bottom of the page, select **Save > Save as** and set the path of the downloaded zip file to **This PC > Documents**.

4. After the download is complete, navigate to the file location in file explorer. Right click on the zip file and click on **Extract All**.

    ![This image shows how to, after going to the GitHub link to download the AzFilesHybrid file, you locate this file in the folder it was saved.](media/extractzipfile.png "AzFilesHybrid module zip file")

5. Set the path to **Documents** and select **Extract**.

    ![This image shows how to choose the location to extract the files within the zip file to the documents folder.](media/extractlocation.png "Extract to documents")

6.  Open an elevated PowerShell ISE window by finding the **PowerShell ISE** icon on the desktop. Right-click on the icon and select **Run as administrator**.

    ![This image shows how to locate the PowerShell icon on the domain computer desktop, right-click and select run as administrator.](media/runasadministrator.png)

7.  Configure the PowerShell execution policy **Unrestricted** for the current user. Select **Yes to All** on **Execution Policy Change** popup.

    ```
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

8.  Navigate to where you unzipped the AzFilesHybrid.

    ```
    cd C:\Users\ADAdmin\Documents\AzFilesHybrid
    ```

    ![This image shows how the path to the file should be the documents folder location in file explorer.](media/filelocation.png "Documents folder path")

9.  Install the Az PowerShell module. Select **Yes** on **NuGet provider is required to continue** popup and select **Yes to All** on **Untrusted Repository** popup.

    ```  
    if ($PSVersionTable.PSEdition -eq 'Desktop' -and (Get-Module -Name AzureRM -ListAvailable)) {
    Write-Warning -Message ('Az module not installed. Having both the AzureRM and ' +
      'Az modules installed at the same time is not supported.')
    } else {
    Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
    }
    ```

10.  Install the AzFilesHybrid module. Select **Run Once** on **Security warning** popup.

```
.\CopyToPSPath.ps1

```

11. Import the AzFilesHybrid module. Select **Run Once** on **Security warning** popup and select **Yes to All** on **Install updated version of PowerShellGet** popup.

    ```  
    Import-Module -Name AzFilesHybrid
    ```

    ![This image shows that after running these commands, the results will look like this screenshot.](images/azimportresults.png "Command results")
    
12. Sign in with your account using the credentials given below:
  * Username: **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail" />**
  * Password: **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword" />**

    ```
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

13.  Create the following PowerShell variables replacing the subscription id, resource group name, and storage account with the information specific to your lab environment:
    

     ```
     $SubscriptionId = "<inject key="Subscription ID" />"
     $ResourceGroupName = "AVD-RG"
     $StorageAccountName = "<inject key="Storage Account Name" />"
     ```

   ![](media/variables.png)

14.  Select the target subscription for the current session.
  

     ```
     Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionId $SubscriptionId
     ```

15. Register the storage account with your Active Directory domain. Select **Run Once** on **Security warning** popup.

    ```
    Join-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName
   
    ```

16. You will be prompted to enter the Azure storage account name, then enter your storage account name **<inject key="Storage Account Name" />** .

    ![This image shows the prompt to enter the Azure storage account after running the join command.](media/enterstorage.png)

17. When the script completes, you will be provided with confirmation that you are connected to the storage account.

    ![This image shows the confirmation of the storage account connection.](media/storageconfirmed.png "Storage account confirmation")

18. Confirm the object was created successfully in **Active Directory Users and Computers** by going to Domain controllers and looking for the computer object for Azure storage account.

    ![This image is what the newly created computer object looks like in Active Directory.](media/confirmnewobject.png "Active Directory object")

19. Confirm that the feature is enabled.

    ```
    $storageaccount = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $StorageAccountName
    ```

20.  List the directory service of the selected service account.
 
     ```
     $storageAccount.AzureFilesIdentityBasedAuth.DirectoryServiceOptions
     ```

21. List the directory domain information if the storage account has enabled AD authentication for file shares.

    ```
    $storageAccount.AzureFilesIdentityBasedAuth.ActiveDirectoryProperties
    ```

    ![This image is what the responses should be when running the previous PowerShell tasks.](media/confirmpowershell.png "PowerShell task responses")


22. Now to confirm activation with your domain by, in the Azure portal, go to the storage account and select **Configuration** under **Settings**. The **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** configuration should be **Enabled**.

    ![This image shows how in the storage account configuration, that Active Directory Domain Services is enabled.](media/portalconfirm.png "Storage account configuration")

You have now successfully enabled AD authentication over SMB and assigned a custom role that provides access to an Azure file share with an AD identity.

### Task 4: Configure share permissions

There are three Azure built-in roles for granting share-level permissions to users and/or groups:

-   **Storage File Data SMB Share Reader**: allows read access in Azure Storage file shares over SMB.

-   **Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor**: allows read, write, and delete access in Azure Storage file shares over SMB.

-   **Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor**: allows read, write, delete, and modify NTFS permissions in Azure Storage file shares over SMB.

To access Azure Files resources with identity-based authentication, an identity (a user, group, or service principal) must have the necessary permissions at the share level. This process is similar to specifying Windows share permissions, where you specify the type of access that a particular user has to a file share. The guidance in this task demonstrates how to assign read, write, or delete permissions for a file share to an identity.

To simplify administration, create 4 new security groups in Active Directory to manage share permissions.

1.  From the domain joined computer, go to **Local Server** and open **Active Directory Users and Computers** from **Tools**. Then navigate to **contoso.com > Builtin** and select the **Create a new group in the current container** icon. 

    ![This image shows how to open the window on the domain controller VM server manager and go to the Active Directory users and computers to create a new security group.](media/adgroups.png "Create new groups")

2.  Create the following Active Directory security groups in an OU that is synchronized with Azure AD:

    -   **AZF FSLogix Contributor**

        ![This image shows how to create a new group object named AZF FSLogix Contributor.](media/azfcontributor.png "AZF FSLogix Contributor")

    -   **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**

        ![This image shows how to create a new group object named AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor.](media/azfelevcontributor.png "AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor")

    -   **AZF FSLogix Reader**

        ![This image shows how to create a new group object named AZF FSLogix Reader.](media/azfreader.png "AZF FSLogix Reader")

    -   **AVD Users**

        ![This image shows how to create a new group object named AVD User.](media/avduser.png "AVD User")

3.  Add the AVD administrative account that you created previously to the group **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**. This account will have permissions to modify file share permissions.

    ![This image shows how to find the AVD admin user that you created previously and right-click to add to a group.](media/chooseadmin.png)

4.  Type **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor** and select **Check Names** to verify. Select **OK** to save.

    ![This image shows how to add the AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor group to this user.](media/addadmin.png)

5.  Add the group **AVD Users** to the group **AZF FSLogix Contributor**. Go to the **Builtin** groups, locate **AVD Users** and right-click to **Add to a group**.
  
    ![This shows how you would find the AVD Users group and add it to a group.](media/avduseraddtogroup.png)

6. Type **AZF FSLogix Contributor** and select **Check Names** to verify. Select **OK** to save.

    ![This image shows where you enter the FSLogix contributor group and check the name before adding.](media/avduseraddgroup.png)

7.  Add user accounts to the **AVD Users** group. Open **OrgUsers**, select all the users and right-click on **Add to a group**. These users will have access to use FSLogix profiles.

    ![This image shows the list of users in the organization, select the users and add them to the AVD Users group.](media/avdaddusers1.png "Add users to the AVD users group")

8. Type **AVD Users** and select **Check Names** to verify. Select **OK** to save.

    ![This image shows where you enter the FSLogix contributor group and check the name before adding.](media/avduseraddgroup.png)

9.  Wait for the new groups to synchronize with Azure AD.  These groups can be verified by going to **Groups** within **Azure Active Directory** and looking for the names in the list.

    ![This image shows how to where you would verify that the groups that were created on the domain controller have synchronized with Azure AD.](media/newgroups.png)

    With the new security groups available in Azure AD, use the following steps to assign them to your storage account in the Azure portal. This will enable to manage share permissions using AD security groups.

10. In the Azure portal, go to **Storage accounts** and open **<inject key="Storage Account Name" />** . Select **Access Control (IAM) > + Add > Add role assignment**. 

    ![This image shows that, in the storage account, under access control, you will locate and select add under add a role assignment.](media/addroleassign.png "Add Azure AD Role assignment")

14. On the Add role assignment fly out, fill in the following options and select **Save**.

    -    **Role**: Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor

    -    **Assign access to**: User, group, or service principal

    -    **Select**: AZF FSLogix Contributor

    ![This image shows how to add the storage file data SMB share contributor role to the AZF FSLogix contributor role that were created within Active Directory.](media/azureadroleassigncontrib.png "Add FSLogix roles to Azure AD File share")

15. Repeat steps 3-4 for the remaining two roles.
    
    -    **Role**: Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor

    -    **Assign access to**: User, group, or service principal

    -    **Select**: AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor

    ![This image shows how to add the storage file data SMB share elevated contributor role to the AZF FSLogix elevated contributor role that were created within Active Directory.](media/azureadroleassignelev.png "Add FSLogix roles to Azure AD File share")

    -    **Role**: Storage File Data SMB Share Reader

    -    **Assign access to**: User, group, or service principal

    -    **Select**: AZF FSLogix Reader  

    ![This image shows how to add the storage file data SMB share reader role to the AZF FSLogix Reader role that were created within Active Directory.](media/azureadroleassignreader.png "Add FSLogix roles to Azure AD File share")

### Task 5: Configure NTFS permissions for the file share

After you assign share-level permissions with Azure RBAC, you must assign proper NTFS permissions at the root, directory, or file level. Think of share-level permissions as the high-level gatekeeper that determines whether a user can access the share. Whereas NTFS permissions act at a more granular level to determine what operations the user can do at the directory or file level.

Azure Files supports the full set of NTFS basic and advanced permissions. You can view and configure NTFS permissions on directories and files in an Azure file share by mounting the share and then using Windows File Explorer or running the Windows iCACLS or Set-ACL command.

The first time you configure NTFS permission, do so using superuser permissions. This is accomplished by mounting the file share using your storage account key.

1. Firstly, you will need to disable secure transfer in the storage account.  Navigate to the storage account and select **Configuration**. Then select **Disabled** under **Secure transfer required** and at last, select **Save** to save the changes.

    ![This image shows how, within the configuration, you will disable secure transfer required and save.](media/disablesecuretransfer.png)

2. Now select **File shares** given in the left pane, under **Data Storage** and open the file share you created earlier.

    ![This image shows how, within the configuration, you will disable secure transfer required and save.](media/openfs.png)


3.  On the file share page, under **Settings**, select **Properties**. Locate the **URL** address and click on copy icon to copy it and paste it in a txt editor for further use. This is the path you will use to access your file share. 

    ![This image shows how to use the storage account properties blade to find the storage account path.](media/storagefileendpoint.png)

4.  Reformat the path to UNC and copy it to a notepad file. For example:

    https://mydomainazfiles.file.core.windows.net/\<file-share-name\> ==
    \\\mydomainazfiles.file.core.windows.net\\\<file-share-name\>

    ![Here is the image of the reformatted name in notepad on the domain controller.](images/notepadreformatted.png)

5.  On the blade for your storage account, under **Settings**, select **Access keys**. Copy and paste the value for **key1** to the same notepad file.

    ![Here is the location of the storage account key to copy to the notepad.](media/copykey.png)

6.  From a domain joined computer, open a standard **Command Prompt** and mount your file share using the storage account key. **Do not** use an elevated command prompt or the mount point will not be visible in File Explorer. 

7. Run the command given below. Refer to the following format for your command and be sure to enter spaces where (space) is noted:

    ```
    net use z:(space) \\<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net\<share-name>(space) <storage-account-key>(space) /user:Azure\<storage-account-name>
    ```

    ![This image shows where to go to the search on Windows to find and open the Command prompt.](media/opencommandprompt.png)

>**Note**: This is an SMB connection on port 445. Most consumer ISPs block this port by default. when you are doing this in your lab and experience issues mounting the share from a local computer, try connecting from a domain joined VM in Azure.


8.  Open **File Explorer**, locate the **Z:** drive. Right-click on the drive and select **Properties**.

    ![](media/successfulstoragemap.png)

9.  On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and select **Advanced**.

    ![This image shows how to, in the properties for the drive, select the security folder and select advanced.](media/drivesecurity.png)

10.  Select **Add** on **Advanced Security Settings** page.

   ![](media/add1.png)

11. Enter the name of your group that are listed below then select **Check Names >OK > OK**(present in the bottom):

  * **AZF FSLogix Contributor**

   ![](media/add2.png)

  * **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor**

   ![](media/add3.png)

  * **AZF FSLogix Reader**

   ![](media/add4.png)

  * **AVD Users**

   ![](media/add5.png)

> **Note**: Only one group can be added at a time, so add one and then repeat the process until all four are added.


    | AD Group | NTFS Permissions |
    |----------|------------------|
    | **AZF FSLogix Contributor** | Modify |
    | **AZF FSLogix Elevated Contributor** | Full control |
    | **AZF FSLogix Reader** | Read & execute |
    | **AVD Users** | Modify (This folder only) |

12. Select **OK** to save your changes.

   ![This image shows how to select add in security settings to add new objects.](media/addsecurity.png)


### Task 6: Configure NTFS permissions for the containers

With the NTFS permissions applied at the root file share, you can now create the FSLogix folder structure and recommended NTFS permissions. There are many ways to create secure and functional storage permissions for use with Profile Containers and Office Container. Below is one configuration option that provides new-user functionality and doesn't require users to have administrative permissions.

In this task we will create directories for each of the FSLogix profile types and assign the recommended permissions.

1.  Navigate to the networked drive in File explorer.

    ![This is an image of where you will find the network drive that you mounted in the previous task.](media/networkdrive.png)

2.  Create three new folder directories in the root share as give below:

  * **Profiles**
  * **ODFC**
  * **MSIX**

    ![This image shows that after adding these folders, file explorer for that shared drive will look like this.](media/newfolders.png)

3.  Right-click on the **Profiles** folder directory and select **Properties**. 

    ![This image shows that after adding these folders, file explorer for that shared drive will look like this.](media/profileprop.png)

4.  On the properties window, select the **Security** tab and select **Advanced**.

    ![This image shows that after adding these folders, file explorer for that shared drive will look like this.](media/security1.png)
